**The domain and its sub-domains are located under this package.** The Domain Layer is where the business is expressed.

Rules:

* The domain is independent of the use cases of the system, but is used to achieve their realization,
* It is a very behaviour-rich and expressive model of the domain, based on entities, values objects and aggregates.
* It contains additional patterns, such as domain services, repositories, factories, policies, etc...
