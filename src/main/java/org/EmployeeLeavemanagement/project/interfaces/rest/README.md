**REST resources and representations are located under this package.** REST is an architectural style which promotes
state transfer between a client (like a browser) and a stateless server through an uniform interface (HTTP in our case).

Rules:

* Domain objects are never exposed without being transformed into DTOs, which are called representations in REST.
* Representations should be as flat as possible.
* Representations can be mapped from and to domain aggregates by assemblers and their DSL facade `FluentAssembler`. They
can also be directly constructed from **read-only** data finders which can bypass the application and domain layers to
efficiently query persistence.
* Using hypermedia should be preferred over hard-coded URLs.
